0	Recommendations:
1	Hotspots	Start with Hotspots analysis to understand the efficiency of your algorithm.	Use Hotspots analysis to identify the most time consuming functions. Drill down to see the time spent on every line of code.
1	Memory Access	The Memory Bound metric is high  (50.3%). A significant fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and stores. 	Use Memory Access analysis to measure metrics that can identify memory access issues.
1	Threading	There is poor utilization of logical CPU cores (15.7%) in your application. 	 Use Threading to explore more opportunities to increase parallelism in your application.
