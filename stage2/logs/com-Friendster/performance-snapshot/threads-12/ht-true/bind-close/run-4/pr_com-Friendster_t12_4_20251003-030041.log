Effective Logical Core Utilization: 10.9% (9.583 out of 88)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first step
 | and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in some cases
 | can improve processor throughput and overall performance of multi-threaded
 | applications.
 |
    Effective Physical Core Utilization: 21.8% (9.583 out of 44)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
     | utilization caused by:
     |     - load imbalance
     |     - threading runtime overhead
     |     - contended synchronization
     |     - thread/process underutilization
     |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
     |       cores
     | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP
     | parallelism or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel
     | bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
     |
Microarchitecture Usage: 29.8% of Pipeline Slots
 | You code efficiency on this platform is too low.
 | 
 | Possible cause: memory stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction
 | or long latency instructions.
 | 
 | Next steps: Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to identify the cause
 | of the low microarchitecture usage efficiency.
 |
    Retiring: 29.8% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 5.1% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 62.6% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 40.2% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.
         |
        Core Bound: 22.4% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
    Bad Speculation: 2.5% of Pipeline Slots
Memory Bound: 40.2% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    L1 Bound: 9.0% of Clockticks
     | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the L1
     | data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency. However, in
     | certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load might suffer a
     | high latency even though it is being satisfied by the L1.
     |
    L2 Bound: 1.1% of Clockticks
    L3 Bound: 5.0% of Clockticks
    DRAM Bound: 25.1% of Clockticks
     | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory (DRAM).
     | Caching typically improves the latency and increases performance.
     |
        DRAM Bandwidth Bound: 0.0% of Elapsed Time
    Store Bound: 11.4% of Clockticks
    NUMA: % of Remote Accesses: 31.2%
     | A significant amount of DRAM loads were serviced from remote DRAM.
     | Wherever possible, try to consistently use data on the same core, or at
     | least the same package, as it was allocated on.
     |
Vectorization: 0.0% of Packed FP Operations
 | A significant fraction of floating point arithmetic instructions are scalar.
 | Use Intel Advisor to see possible reasons why the code was not vectorized.

    Threading: There is poor utilization of logical CPU cores (10.9%) in your application. 
     |  Use Threading to explore more opportunities to increase parallelism in
     | your application.
    Microarchitecture Exploration: There is low microarchitecture usage (29.8%) of available hardware resources. 
     | Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to analyze CPU
     | microarchitecture bottlenecks that can affect application performance.
    Memory Access: The Memory Bound metric is high  (40.2%). A significant fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and stores. 
     | Use Memory Access analysis to measure metrics that can identify memory
     | access issues.
