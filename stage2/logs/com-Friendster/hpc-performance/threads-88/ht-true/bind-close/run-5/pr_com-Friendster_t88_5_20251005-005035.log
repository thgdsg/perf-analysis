    CPI Rate: 3.148
     | The CPI may be too high. This could be caused by issues such as memory
     | stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction or long latency
     | instructions. Explore the other hardware-related metrics to identify what
     | is causing high CPI.
     |
    Average CPU Frequency: 2.804 GHz 
    Total Thread Count: 88
Effective Physical Core Utilization: 76.6% (33.726 out of 44)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 38.3% (33.676 out of 88)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.
     |
Memory Bound: 74.5% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    Cache Bound: 75.9% of Clockticks
     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from
     | caches. Check Memory Access analysis to see if accesses to L2 or L3
     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.
     |
    DRAM Bound: 3.7% of Clockticks
        DRAM Bandwidth Bound: 33.6% of Elapsed Time
         | The system spent much time heavily utilizing DRAM bandwidth. Improve
         | data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers from/to memory using
         | these possible techniques: 1) consume all bytes of each cacheline
         | before it is evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and
         | split non-hot ones); 2) merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited
         | loops; 3) use NUMA optimizations on a multi-socket system. Note:
         | software prefetches do not help a bandwidth-limited application. Run
         | Memory Access analysis to identify data structures to be allocated in
         | High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), if available.
