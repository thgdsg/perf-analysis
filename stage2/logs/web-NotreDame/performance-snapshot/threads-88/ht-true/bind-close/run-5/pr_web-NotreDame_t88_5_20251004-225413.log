Effective Logical Core Utilization: 5.2% (4.557 out of 88)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first step
 | and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in some cases
 | can improve processor throughput and overall performance of multi-threaded
 | applications.
 |
    Effective Physical Core Utilization: 10.4% (4.556 out of 44)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
     | utilization caused by:
     |     - load imbalance
     |     - threading runtime overhead
     |     - contended synchronization
     |     - thread/process underutilization
     |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
     |       cores
     | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP
     | parallelism or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel
     | bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
     |
Microarchitecture Usage: 32.7% of Pipeline Slots
 | You code efficiency on this platform is too low.
 | 
 | Possible cause: memory stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction
 | or long latency instructions.
 | 
 | Next steps: Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to identify the cause
 | of the low microarchitecture usage efficiency.
 |
    Retiring: 32.7% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 14.9% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 23.5% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 14.3% of Pipeline Slots
        Core Bound: 9.3% of Pipeline Slots
    Bad Speculation: 28.9% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant proportion of pipeline slots containing useful work are
     | being cancelled. This can be caused by mispredicting branches or by
     | machine clears. Note that this metric value may be highlighted due to
     | Branch Resteers issue.

    NUMA: % of Remote Accesses: 43.3%
     | A significant amount of DRAM loads were serviced from remote DRAM.
     | Wherever possible, try to consistently use data on the same core, or at
     | least the same package, as it was allocated on.

Recommendations:
    Hotspots: Start with Hotspots analysis to understand the efficiency of your algorithm.
     | Use Hotspots analysis to identify the most time consuming functions.
     | Drill down to see the time spent on every line of code.
    Threading: There is poor utilization of logical CPU cores (5.2%) in your application. 
     |  Use Threading to explore more opportunities to increase parallelism in
     | your application.
    Microarchitecture Exploration: There is low microarchitecture usage (32.7%) of available hardware resources. 
     | Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to analyze CPU
     | microarchitecture bottlenecks that can affect application performance.
