Effective Logical Core Utilization: 3.3% (2.880 out of 88)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first step
 | and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in some cases
 | can improve processor throughput and overall performance of multi-threaded
 | applications.

    Effective Physical Core Utilization: 3.6% (1.568 out of 44)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
     | utilization caused by:
     |     - load imbalance
     |     - threading runtime overhead
     |     - contended synchronization
     |     - thread/process underutilization
     |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
     |       cores
     | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP
     | parallelism or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel
     | bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.

Recommendations:
    Hotspots: Start with Hotspots analysis to understand the efficiency of your algorithm.
     | Use Hotspots analysis to identify the most time consuming functions.
     | Drill down to see the time spent on every line of code.
    Threading: There is poor utilization of logical CPU cores (3.3%) in your application. 
     |  Use Threading to explore more opportunities to increase parallelism in
     | your application.
    Microarchitecture Exploration: There is low microarchitecture usage (55.3%) of available hardware resources. 
     | Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to analyze CPU
     | microarchitecture bottlenecks that can affect application performance.
