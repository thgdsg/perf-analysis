Effective Physical Core Utilization: 6.6% (2.918 out of 44)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 3.3% (2.920 out of 88)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.
