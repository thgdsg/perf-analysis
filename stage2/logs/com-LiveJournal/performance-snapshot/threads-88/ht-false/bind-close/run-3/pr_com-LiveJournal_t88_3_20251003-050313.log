 | Application execution time is too short. Metrics data may be unreliable.
 | Consider reducing the sampling interval or increasing your application
 | execution time.
 |
    IPC: 0.428
     | The IPC may be too low. This could be caused by issues such as memory
     | stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction or long latency
     | instructions. Explore the other hardware-related metrics to identify what
     | is causing low IPC.

    x87 GFLOPS: 0.006
    Average CPU Frequency: 2.800 GHz 
Effective Logical Core Utilization: 55.0% (48.423 out of 88)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first step
 | and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in some cases
 | can improve processor throughput and overall performance of multi-threaded
 | applications.
 |
    Effective Physical Core Utilization: 55.3% (24.316 out of 44)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
     | utilization caused by:
     |     - load imbalance
     |     - threading runtime overhead
     |     - contended synchronization
     |     - thread/process underutilization
     |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
     |       cores
     | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP
     | parallelism or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel
     | bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
     |
Microarchitecture Usage: 30.7% of Pipeline Slots
 | You code efficiency on this platform is too low.
 | 
 | Possible cause: memory stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction
 | or long latency instructions.
 | 
 | Next steps: Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to identify the cause
 | of the low microarchitecture usage efficiency.
 |
    Retiring: 30.7% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 16.6% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 52.5% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 28.7% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.
         |
        Core Bound: 23.8% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
    Bad Speculation: 0.2% of Pipeline Slots
Memory Bound: 28.7% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    L1 Bound: 0.0% of Clockticks
    L2 Bound: 33.5% of Clockticks
     | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding
     | cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the latency and increase
     | performance.
     |
    L3 Bound: 2.4% of Clockticks
    DRAM Bound: 7.4% of Clockticks
        DRAM Bandwidth Bound: 0.0% of Elapsed Time
    Store Bound: 14.9% of Clockticks
    NUMA: % of Remote Accesses: 38.6%

Recommendations:
    Increase execution time:  
     | Application execution time is too short. Metrics data may be unreliable.
     | Consider reducing the sampling interval or increasing your application
     | execution time.
    Hotspots: Start with Hotspots analysis to understand the efficiency of your algorithm.
     | Use Hotspots analysis to identify the most time consuming functions.
     | Drill down to see the time spent on every line of code.
    Microarchitecture Exploration: There is low microarchitecture usage (30.7%) of available hardware resources. 
     | Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to analyze CPU
     | microarchitecture bottlenecks that can affect application performance.
    Threading: There is poor utilization of logical CPU cores (55.0%) in your application. 
     |  Use Threading to explore more opportunities to increase parallelism in
     | your application.
    Memory Access: The Memory Bound metric is high  (28.7%). A significant fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and stores. 
     | Use Memory Access analysis to measure metrics that can identify memory
     | access issues.
